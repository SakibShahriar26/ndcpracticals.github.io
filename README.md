# Practical Guideline
This guideline is being written by Sakib Shahriar (#12615094) solely for the purpose of helping the fellow lab-mates of the lab groups E4 (Science) and G1 (ICT). This guideline will be updated time to time after each lab session of the aforementioned group. Additionally, samples of rough sheets and fair sheets will be available as well.

  On this day, during the lab class, besides an introductory session on lab apparatus, a sample of preparing rough sheets was demonstrated. The instructions are listed below:
  
  + Use A4 sized paper.
  + On the top right corner, over the horizontal margin, write the roll number (don't use #) and date (in the next line).
  + In the main body of the rough sheet, you have to write 6 points (Number of the Experiment, Name of the Experiment, Principle, Required Apparatus, Required Chemicals, Table). These are to be written in left alignment.
  + The table is to be made with a pencil, and the rest of the writings are to be done with a black pen.
