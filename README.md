# Labclass Trackbook
This guideline is being written by Sakib Shahriar (#12615094) solely for the purpose of helping the fellow lab-mates of the lab groups E4 (Science) and G1 (ICT). This guideline will be updated time to time after each lab session of the aforementioned lab group. Even though, it is dedicated for the lab-mates of my group, students of any other lab group are welcome to follow the general guidelines as well. Additionally, samples of rough sheets and fair sheets *might* be posted here as well.
## Physics
<details>
  <summary>Class 01: 08/10/2024</summary>
  <p> On this day, during the lab class, besides an introductory session on lab apparatus, a sample of preparing rough sheets was demonstrated. The instructions are listed below: </p>
  <ul>
  <li> For each experiment, a rough sheet has to be prepared at home.</li>
  <li> For the preparation of a rough sheet, A4 sized paper with standard margine has to be used.</li>
  <li> On the top right corner, over the horizontal margin, write the roll number (don't use #) and date (in the next line). </li>
  <li> In the main body of the rough sheet, everything has to be written in left allignment. </li>
  <li> Here, you have to write exactly six points, namely- Number of the Experiment, Name of the Experiment, Principle, Required Apparatus, Required Chemicals, Table. </li>
  <li> The table is to be made with a pencil, and the rest of the writings are to be done with a black pen. </li>
  <li> If needed, additional pages can be used and writing on both sides of the rough sheet is suggested.</li>
  <li> If additional page(s) is/are used, then they are to be stapled at the top-left corner.</li>
  <li> Use of blue pens in the rough sheet is *probably* allowed.</li>
  <li> On the next day, the rough sheet has to be shown while entering the lab, where it will be checked and sealed (if found perfect). Otherwise, makeup! ðŸ™‚</li>
  </ul>

## Biology

  <summary>Class 01: 08/10/2024</summary>
  <p> On this day, during the lab class, besides an introductory session on the components and usage of compound light microscope, instructions for next class have been provided. The instructions are listed below: </p>
  <ul>
  <li> On every lab session, a work sheet from the practical lab book has to be brought. A work sheet consists of three sheets; a thick sheet for drawing, a thin sheet for covering and a sheet for writing.</li>
  <li> There is no need of writing anything on the work sheet. The work sheet has to be free of wrinkles or creases. </li>
  <li> The following things are required for each class:</li>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>2x slide (size: 1 inch or 2.5 inch)</li>
        <li>2x watch glass</li>
        <li>2x blade</li>
        <li>5x cover slip</li>
        <li>2x practical sized brush</li>
        <li>2x pencil (One HB Pencil and one 2B pencil)</li>
        <li>1x eraser</li>
      </ol>
  <li> Usually, these can be bought from the stationary shop of NDC at a price not more than 150 BDT. These can also be bought from Ittefaq Mor, where there are shops that sell scientific equipments. </li>
  <li> If any of the aforementioned instructions is not followed, be ready for a makeup! ðŸ™‚</li>
  </ul>
