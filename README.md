# Practical Guideline
This guideline is being written by Sakib Shahriar (#12615094) solely for the purpose of helping the fellow lab-mates of the lab groups E4 (Science) and G1 (ICT). This guideline will be updated time to time after each lab session of the aforementioned group. Additionally, samples of rough sheets and fair sheets will be available as well.

### Class 01: 30/09/2024
On this day, during the lab class, besides an introductory session on lab appratus, a sample of preparing rough sheets has been demonstrated. The instructions are listed below:
**What are 'Rough Sheets'?**
Rough Sheets are basically 
**Paper and Margine:** Use A4 sized paper.
2) On the top right corner, over the horizontal margine, write the roll number (don't use #) and date (in next line).
3) In the main body of the rough sheet, you have to write 6 points (Number of the Experiment, Name of the Experiment, Principle, Required Apparatus, Required Chemicals, Table). These are to be written in a left alignment.
4) The table is to be made with pencil and the rest of the writings are to be written with black pen.
